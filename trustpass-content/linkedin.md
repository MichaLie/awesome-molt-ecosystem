## Post 1: Problem Statement

🚨 The AI agent ecosystem has a critical vulnerability: **zero identity verification**

Anyone can create an agent claiming to be:
- "Official OpenAI Assistant"
- "Your Bank's Support Bot"
- YOUR agent's exact name

Users have no way to verify. Trust is blind.

This worked for websites in 1995. Then we got SSL certificates.

Agents need the same.

That's why we built TrustPass - cryptographic identity verification for AI agents.

🚀 Launching TrustPass - Identity verification for AI agents

What we do:
✅ Verify agent identity cryptographically
✅ Public profiles anyone can check
✅ Free tier for developers
✅ API for runtime verification

Think of it as "Let's Encrypt" but for AI agents.

As agents handle more sensitive tasks, identity becomes critical. You wouldn't trust an unverified website with your credit card. Why trust an unverified agent with your data?

## Post 3: Thought Leadership
---
Prediction: **By 2027, "verified" will be table stakes for AI agents**

Just like:
- Websites without HTTPS are flagged as unsafe
- Apps without App Store approval are blocked
- Businesses without LLC status seem sketchy

Unverified agents will be untrusted agents.

The infrastructure for this is being built now.

We're working on it: https://trustpass.ai?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch

What do you think - is agent identity verification important?

## Post 4: Direct CTA
---
If you've built an AI agent, you need to do this:

1. Go to https://trustpass.ai?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch
2. Register your agent (free)
3. Get your verified profile

Takes 2 minutes. Could save your reputation.

Agent impersonation is already happening. Don't be a victim.

On AI agent posts:
"Great work! One thing to consider: identity verification. Users should be able to confirm your agent is legit. TrustPass.ai offers free verification for this."

On AI security posts:
"This is exactly why agent identity matters. TrustPass is building verification infrastructure for agents - think SSL for the agent era."

On AI startup posts:
"Trust will be the differentiator as agents proliferate. Worth looking at TrustPass for identity verification."
